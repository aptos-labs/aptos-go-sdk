// Package bcs implements Binary Canonical Serialization [BCS].
//
// The bcs package can be used to serialize and deserialize complex types into a binary canonical format that is non-self describing.  Meaning that you will need to know the format ahead of time in order to serialize and deserialize. Check out [Serializer] for serialization and [Deserializer] for deserialization.
